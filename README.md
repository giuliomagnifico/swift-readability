# Readability
A Swift library that wraps [@mozilla/readability](https://github.com/@mozilla/readability) and generalizes the Firefox Reader, which enhances web pages for better reading.
This library provides a seamless way to detect, parse, and display reader-friendly content from any web page by integrating with WKWebView.

## About this fork

This project is a fork of [Ryu0118/swift-readability](https://github.com/Ryu0118/swift-readability) and retains its `@mozilla/readability` foundation, general features, API surface, credits, and license information.

The fork was originally developed for [Lettura](https://www.giuliomagnifico.dev/apps/lettura/), a native RSS reader for Apple platforms where article extraction is invoked repeatedly while opening articles. It is optimized for repeated parsing workloads by reusing a persistent `WKWebView` runner rather than creating a new web view for every parse.

The runner installs its JavaScript bootstrap scripts once and reuses them. It has single-flight semantics: starting a new parse can invalidate or cancel the currently active parse. Request IDs reject stale callbacks, every parse has a global 10-second deadline, and the runner recovers after cancellation, timeout, or WebKit failure so it remains usable. `isProbablyReaderable` is treated as a heuristic rather than a gate, so `Readability.parse()` is still attempted when the heuristic returns `false`.

This is a deliberate trade-off, not a universal replacement for upstream. Upstream creates a separate `WKWebView` for each parse, providing stronger isolation and allowing independent concurrent parses. This fork prioritizes runner reuse and lower repeated-parsing overhead.

## Performance

Repository benchmarks for the persistent runner:

| Fixture | Persistent median | Cold median |
| ------- | ----------------: | ----------: |
| Small   |            2.8 ms |     64.9 ms |
| Medium  |            7.7 ms |     66.5 ms |
| Large   |           31.7 ms |     89.6 ms |

“Persistent” reuses the existing runner and `WKWebView`; “cold” creates and uses a fresh runner and web view for the parse. These are repository benchmark results, not general performance guarantees: real-world performance depends on hardware, HTML complexity, and workload.

Run the benchmark with:

```sh
READABILITY_BENCHMARK=1 swift test --filter ReadabilityTests/testBenchmarkPersistentRunner
```

## Reliability

The persistent-runner tests cover sequential parsing, 100 consecutive parses on one runner, cancellation followed by successful recovery, timeout followed by a stale callback and recovery, and successful subsequent parsing after timeout or cancellation. They also cover stale-callback protection, no accumulation of `WKUserScript` instances or message handlers, and cases where `isProbablyReaderable` returns `false` while `Readability.parse()` succeeds.


## Features
- **Parsing** <br>
Parse a URL or HTML string into a structured article using [@mozilla/readability](https://github.com/@mozilla/readability).
- **WKWebView Integration**<br>
Easily integrate with WKWebView.
- **Reader Mode Overlay**<br>
Easily toggle a reader overlay with customizable themes and font sizes.

## Requirements
- **Xcode:** 16.4 or later

## Installation
swift-readability is available via the Swift Package Manager
```swift
.package(
    url: "https://github.com/giuliomagnifico/swift-readability",
    .upToNextMinor(from: "0.4.1")
)
```

## Usage
### Basic Parsing
You can parse an article either from a URL or directly from an HTML string.<br>

Parsing from a URL:
```swift
import Readability

let readability = Readability()
let result = try await readability.parse(url: URL(string: "https://example.com/article")!)
```

Parsing from an HTML string:
```swift
import Readability

let html = """
<html>
    <!-- Your HTML content here -->
</html>
"""
let result = try await readability.parse(html: html)
```

### Implementing Reader Mode with WKWebView
swift-readability provides `ReadabilityWebCoordinator` that prepares a `WKWebView` configuration, and exposes two asynchronous streams: `contentParsed` (emitting generated reader HTML) and `availabilityChanged` (emitting reader mode availability updates). This configuration enables your `WKWebView` to detect when a web page is suitable for reader mode, generate a reader-friendly HTML overlay, and toggle reader mode dynamically.

```swift
import ReadabilityUI

let coordinator = ReadabilityWebCoordinator(initialStyle: ReaderStyle(theme: .dark, fontSize: .size5))
let configuration = try await coordinator.createReadableWebViewConfiguration()
let webView = WKWebView(frame: .zero, configuration: configuration)

// Process generated reader HTML asynchronously.
for await html in coordinator.contentParsed {
    do {
        try await webView.showReaderContent(with: html)
    } catch {
        // Handle the error here.
    }
}

// Monitor reader mode availability asynchronously.
for await availability in coordinator.availabilityChanged {
    // For example, update your UI to enable or disable the reader mode button.
}
```

### ReaderControllable Protocol

Below are usage examples for each of the functions provided by the `ReaderControllable` protocol extension. Since `WKWebView` conforms to `ReaderControllable`, you can call these methods directly on your `WKWebView` instance.

> [!WARNING]
>  Changes to the reader style (theme and font size) are only available when the web view is in Reader Mode.

```swift
import ReadabilityUI

// Set the entire reader style (theme and font size)
try await webView.set(style: ReaderStyle(theme: .dark, fontSize: .size5))

// Set only the reader theme (supports sepia, light, and dark).
try await webView.set(theme: .sepia)

// Set only the font size
try await webView.set(fontSize: .size7)

// Show the reader overlay using the HTML received from the ReadabilityWebCoordinator.contentParsed(_:) event.
try await webView.showReaderContent(with: html)

// Hide the reader overlay.
try await webView.hideReaderContent()

// Determine if the web view is currently in reader mode.
let isReaderMode = try await webView.isReaderMode()
```

If you are using a SwiftUI wrapper library for WKWebView (such as [Cybozu/WebUI](https://github.com/cybozu/WebUI)) that does not expose the WKWebView instance, you can conform any object that has an evaluateJavaScript method to ReaderControllable. For example:
```swift
import WebUI
import ReadabilityUI

extension WebViewProxy: @retroactive ReaderControllable {}
```
By conforming `WebViewProxy` to `ReaderControllable`, you can control the reader from the proxy, for example:
```swift
WebViewReader { proxy in
    WebView(configuration: configuration)
        .task {
            for await html in coordinator.contentParsed {
                if let url = proxy.url {
                    try? await proxy.showReaderContent(with: html)
                    try? await proxy.set(theme: .dark)
                    try? await proxy.set(fontSize: .size8)
                }
            }
        }
}
```
